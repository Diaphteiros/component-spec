Gardener Component-Descriptor Contract and Specification
========================================================


This document describes the contract `Resolvable` components adhere to in order to declare in a
machine-readable way dependency graphs of multiple `Resolvable` components and their dependencies.

Said contract consists of the schema and format specification of so-called `Component Descriptors`,
as well as a definition of how to publish, persist, discover, and retrieve `Component Descriptors`.
